            Dimitrescu Castle is a large medieval castle owned by the Dimitrescu family and located in an Eastern European village.
            Who controlled the castle at the time is not known, although it eventually fell into the hands of the Dimitrescu family,
            who maintained a feudal, sometimes even tyrannical, rule over the people of their region. In the <span class="numbers">2020</span>s, 
            the castle was the site of a series of brutal murders and mutilations instigated by the local nobility against the peasants.
